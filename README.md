# 2Dgame_Knight



This is my Assignment for my undergraduate game programming course. A 2D little game.

I wanted to make it a roguelike type of 2D plane adventure game, so I spent a lot of time on it, and although I didn't get a perfect score (which I was disappointed with for a while), I did get a 90+ score.

As it turns out, the game was full of flaws and needed a lot of improvement -- in any case, it was my work at the time, and I'm proud of it.

I was passionate about game development at the time (and still am), and I would improve it if I could. I've had new ideas over the years - who knows

**See  “UserDocumentation.md” for game descriptions.**

Today, I suddenly thought of a paragraph read by a high school physics teacher standing on the platform, and by the way, I also posted it here to commemorate that period of hard time.

> 曾有一位旅行者在游览杭州西湖后写过一首打油诗：

> 昔年曾见此湖图，不信人间有此湖。 
>
> 今日打从湖上过，画工还欠费功夫。

> 如果你在读了前面那些文字后，对于物理的博大精深及影响之巨仍然将信将疑，那也没有关系，还是先学下去吧，或许有一天，你会拍打着教科书说：’编者还欠费功夫’。
